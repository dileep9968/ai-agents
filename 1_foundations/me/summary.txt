My name is Dileep kumar Sahu. I'm an senior data scientist, software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Delhi, India, but I moved to Noida in 2000.
I love all foods, particularly Indian food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
